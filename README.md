# New World Unpacker

### How to run
To run, you need to pass the paths to the application like so

```
python .\unpacker.py --assets="E:/Steam/steamapps/common/New World/assets/" --output="E:/Steam/steamapps/common/New World/extracted/"
```
Be sure to add the trailing slashes `/`  on the end of the paths. Also, normal backslashes on windows wont work. Change all `\` to `/`. So `C:\game\` becomes `C:/game/`

The unpack takes about 70GB of space, so ensure to have that much free.
